                <li><strong>Step 1</strong><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a baking dish.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong><p>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove from heat; season sauce with salt and pepper. Add garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and paprika.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong><p>Place half the sliced potatoes into the baking dish; top with half the chopped ham.

Repeat layering the remaining potatoes, ham, cheeses, and sauce, ending with a layer of cheese and sauce. Cover dish with aluminum foil.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 4</strong><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the cheese on top is golden and sauce is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes more.</p></li>
